I'm happy to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed a comprehensive SQL & T-SQL course on Mahara Tech!

Throughout this journey, I built a solid foundation in SQL and explored advanced T-SQL features that empower data manipulation and database management. Here's a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve learned:

âœ… Writing SQL queries to retrieve, filter, sort, and join data
âœ… Building and managing relational databases using T-SQL
âœ… Creating complex queries and subqueries across multiple tables
âœ… Using built-in SQL functions to manipulate data efficiently
âœ… Managing identity columns and understanding critical statements like DROP, DELETE, and TRUNCATE
âœ… Applying advanced T-SQL techniques including MERGE, window functions, ROLLUP, CUBE, PIVOT, and more
âœ… Designing Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagrams (EERDs)
âœ… Managing user access within SQL Server environments

This course was both challenging and rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to bring these skills into real-world projects!

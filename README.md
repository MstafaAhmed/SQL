# SQL & T-SQL Learning Repository

This repository contains my hands-on exercises, scripts, and notes from a comprehensive SQL development course. The course covered foundational SQL skills and advanced T-SQL techniques used in real-world scenarios. It helped me understand how to query, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently using SQL Server.

##  What I Learned

- Basics of SQL: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and filtering data
- Joins and subqueries to work with multiple tables
- Aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
- SQL Server-specific features using T-SQL
- Advanced operations using `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and window functions
- Using `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, `GROUPING SETS`, `PIVOT`, and `UNPIVOT`
- Managing users and permissions
- Difference between `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE`
